# Filtered_YT
Something I made to help prevent distractions while watchin a Youtube video

##How to use:

###Search:

Search on youtube by typing in a query in the textbox and press Search

###Load:

Load a YT video by entering the video ID in the text box and click Load

I kept it ugly to help focus.
Any suggestions and improvements are welcome.
